### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt the use of flexbox through this project. The flex display is a display that makes the website look nice. I also learnt how to make the website responsive over different screen sizes.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@media only screen and (max-width : 750px){
}
.fa:hover{
 color: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
 border: 1px solid hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
}

```
